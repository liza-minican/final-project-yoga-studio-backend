## Final Project Backend

## The process

-Sketch in Figma

-Deciding on the pages and components I want to have

-Deciding on the logic required by the frontend  

-Planning the endpoints that i would want to have

-Created the following endpoints using methods like find(), findOne(), findById:

## View it live

https://yoga-studio-liza.herokuapp.com/

https://yoga-studio-liza.herokuapp.com/videos - all videos, this  endpoint is working for getting the videos and posting a video by an admin

https://yoga-studio-liza.herokuapp.com/videos/602f9e661d000f0028531ebd -find video by id, in the frontend it works when a user clicks on one of the videos

https://yoga-studio-liza.herokuapp.com/videos/length/30 - find a video by length, replace 30 with 15 or 20

There are a few other endpoints - for sign in/sign up logic, fetching favorite videos of a specific user and posting/deleting videos by an admin.

## Focus

-Buildi API using MongoDB

-Create and build connections between schemas

-Create endpoints with the comfort of using them by the front end in mind
